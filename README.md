# SOS-Game
A game that I created using Java!

This is what the GUI looks like when you first run the program.

My favorite thing about this GUI is that when you change the board size, the outer board size does not change.

The hardest part of this project was trying to figure out how I could draw the shapes and lines onto the board and have it relate to the game logic. But here is what the board looks like having played a few games.

I also implemented computer opponents that play the game for you.
