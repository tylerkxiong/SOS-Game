# SOS-Game
A game that I created using Java!

In the game, you can choose game mode, Simple Game or General Game. Simple game is a game where the first player to get an SOS wins. General game is where the player who has the most SOS connections when the board is filled wins. You can change your board size, choose whether you want to put an S or and O down for each player. You can also choose to play against computers or have the computers play against each other. You can also record the game moves that lists the moves in a txt file.

This is what the GUI looks like when you first run the program.

My favorite thing about this GUI is that when you change the board size, the outer board size does not change.

The hardest part of this project was trying to figure out how I could draw the shapes and lines onto the board and have it relate to the game logic. But here is what the board looks like having played a few games.
